				<h3>Qualifications</h3><br /> 
				<p>
				I qualified as a Career Coach through the Dublin Institute of Technology. I hold a BSc(Hons) in Psychology
				and am a member of the British Psychological Society. I am also a qualified Psychometrics Tester in a wide 
				range of Psychometric Assessments. I have 20 years’ experience coaching and developing people in multiple
				management roles. I have career coached clients from diverse backgrounds and occupations as well as clients
				about to retire helping them successfully transition to the next phase of their lives.
				</p><br /><br /><br />

				<h3>Experience</h3><br /> 
				<p>
				In addition to Career Coaching and people development experience, I can provide the benefits of real world experience from my
				former roles including Operations and Change Management, Print and Supply Chain, Process Design and Improvement, HR, Banking, IT
				and Training and Communications. Such a range and depth of experience gives me unique insight into what employers are looking for
				across a wide range of roles. As a result, I can help clients to identify and match what in their existing experience makes them
				uniquely qualified for the role they are now considering or would like to consider, and how to use and express that knowledge
				confidently and effectively.<br /> 
				</p><br /><br /> 
				
				<p>
				My coaching style is open, friendly, supportive and empathic. You will be ‘wowed’ by your new CV; you will be able to face all types
				of interviews feeling prepared and confident; you will impress widely with your updated social media/LinkedIn profile. I am passionate 
				about helping clients increase in confidence, helping them in learning to identify, value and appreciate the skills, talents and
				experience they have and helping them express this effectively and professionally. This leads clients to focused and practical solutions.  
				</p><br /><br /><br /><br />
					
				<h3>Testimonial</h3><br /> 
				<p>
				<i><q>Since you created my C.V. I have had four interviews. During each interview my C.V. was complimented and praised for the way 
				it was written. I have just received word that I will be starting my new job later this month. I would just like the take the time 
				to express my gratitude for the assistance you provided me with regards to my C.V. Thank you.</i></q>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;M O'C, Cork
